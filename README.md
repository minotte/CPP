<h1 align='center'> CPP </h1>

# Project

The **CPP Piscine** is a rigorous, hands-on bootcamp at 42, designed to teach the basics of C++ through a series of projects that cover topics ranging from object-oriented programming to memory management and advanced language features. Each module builds upon the previous one, reinforcing concepts and encouraging a deeper understanding of C++â€™s core principles.


# Constraints
According to the subject there is 4 constraints for this project:
*  All files can be compiled with the flag ``-std=c++98``.
*  The ``using namespace <ns_name>`` and ``friend`` keywords are forbidden
*  From Module 02 to Module 09, all classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated otherwise
*  STL(containers and algorithm functions) only allowed in module 08 and 09


# Modules

| Module | Description |
|:------:| ----------- |
|   **00**   | Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff        |
|   **01**   | Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement        | 
|   **02**   | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form        |
|   **03**   | Inheritance        | 
|   **04**   | Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces        |
|   **05**   | Repetition and Exceptions        | 
|   **06**   | C++ casts  |
|   **07**   | C++ templates        |
|   **08**   | Templated containers, iterators, algorithms        |
|   **09**   | STL        |


# Usage

Each module contains a folder for each exercise, and all exercises can be compiled by running the following commands from the corresponding folder.

``make`` to compile the project executable.

``make clean`` to clean all compiled files without the executable.

``make fclean`` to clean all compiled files with the executable.

``make re`` to fclean then make.
